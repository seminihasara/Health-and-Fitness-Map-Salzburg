## üé® Design Choices
- Soft green for showing the green spaces 
- Icons chosen to reflect different facility types including hospital, pharmacy and wellness centers
  Here i have used the wellknown symbols for the hospitals since it is easy for the user to distinctive the symbol
  ex: Red color plus sin for Hospital
  But for the pharamcy i changed the symbol which shows medical dose.

  The icons were downlaoded through 
  
- Intuitive layer control placement for ease of use
  Here the user can customize the layers they want to see in the map.
  Ex: If they just need to see the Hospitals and the Pharmacies they can decideded the layers to view. 

##üõ†Ô∏èPotential improvement
- Based on the Data availability I just used the opening housrs of the pharmacy layer . If we can show the opening hours of the fitness centers as well it will be useful
- If we can show up the whel cahair accesibility, pet friendly like data it will be more important for the user as well.
