## üó∫Ô∏è Map Features
- Base Map
  Here i have use the basemap provides by the leaflet. I have selected the CartoDB.Voyager base map. It shows important label including the city names and shows physical features like green ares and water body areas in a light color.This wll helps to identify the user e the loaction of helath facilities (Especially the residents since they are familiar with the existing landmarks) . It is important to highlight the key details of Health facilities than the base map.

- I have use following point layers and the details for pop up content (attribute) as follows.
-  Pharmacies - Name and the Opening Hours
-  Dental Clinic- Name, opening Hours
-  Doctors - Name, Speciality, Opening Hours, Email and Website
-  Hospital - Name

- Layer control to toggle different categories
  
- Icons chosen to reflect different facility types:
  
- Red color for Hospital symbol (cross)
- Medicine icon for Pharmacy
- Tooth icon for Dental Clinic
- Stethoscope for Doctor consultation 

## üóÇÔ∏è Data Sources

- OpenStreetMap data via Overpass Turbo was used to download the Pharmacies , Dental Clinic , Doctors, Hospital
  
- For the icons i have used the following website
https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/free


## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology
1. Prepared GeoJSON data files using Overpass Turbo.
2. Designed the map interface with Leaflet.
3. Styled layers using  JavaScript.
4. Added interactivity: popups
5. Hosted the map using GitHub Page.

## üé® Design Choices
- Icons chosen to reflect different facility types including hospital, pharmacy, Doctor consulation office and dentals.
  Here I have used the wellknown symbols for the hospitals since it is easy for the user to distinctive the symbol
  ex: Red color for Hospital
  But for the pharamcy I changed the symbol which shows medical dose.
  For dentals  I have used an icon suit for dental facility (Tooth) . This helps the user to easily recognise it.
  
- Intuitive layer control placement for ease of use
  Here the user can customize the layers they want to see in the map.
  Ex: If they just need to see the Hospitals and the Pharmacies they can decideded the layers to view. 

##üõ†Ô∏èPotential improvement
- Based on the Data availability I just used the opening hours of the pharmacy, Dental clinic and the Doctor channeling centers . since here every resident is insured if we can add the type of the insurance for dental clinc and Doctors chanelling centers it will be useful for the reader .
- If we can show up the pet friendly, Requirement of Appointments like data it will be more important for the user.
-Since we have large amount of doctor channelling data it is difficult for the user at the first sight. If we can use one symbol for a cluster at a certain zoom level, it will be good. I tried to add it. But it does not work.
- If We can show the location of the user and the distance to the facility, it will be useful as well.
